# bingo

a simple spreadsheet for generating custom bingo games. 

"stochastic fun for the whole family!" 

## how to play

Every time the book is refreshed, the board will change randomly.  Print the board sheet out or copy its values to another sheet to "freeze" it.

## how it works

In the "Events" sheet, every bingo item is assigned a random value between 0 and 1.  Then all of these values are sorted.  On the "Board" sheet, the top 24 items are put in the squares.  It's really, really simple!

## how to customize

Add/change items to the Events sheet and drag down the random and rank columns as needed.  If you don't give it at least 24 items, you'll have blanks on the board.  The more items, the more different each board will be.  That's it.

I removed a bunch of identifiable information from the original version, which wasn't as much of a generic "conference calls in general" bingo as it was poking fun at specific people on our calls.  Fiddle with it as you wish.  Obviously, you can also change the topic altogether--great candidates include public transit, family holidays, etc.

look, do whatever you want with this, but don't take it and say no one else can use it, and have fun
